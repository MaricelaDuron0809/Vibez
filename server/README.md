### introduction  
   
  **_Vibez_** is a social media application founded on musical interest and the unifying, universal power that music has on the human psyche. More specifically, **_Vibez_** is based around sharing music playlists and the conversations that can spring up from the free exchange of information and art. In our application, people can sign up, create playlists, listen to those playlists, listen to the playlists of other people, make posts on playlists, comment on the posts, and like posts. We chose to use the Spotify API because so many people already have an account with it, despite having heard tell of its notoriety for being difficult to inteact with.

### unsolved problems  
  we had unresolved problems with heroku and getting the user data, so we were unable to get full CRUD on users.

  
### future enhancements
  we would want to add a chat room for people to be able to discuss music and even jam together with extemporaneous music.
