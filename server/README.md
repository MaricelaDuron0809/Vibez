### introduction  
   
  **_Vibez_** is a social media application founded on musical interest and the unifying, universal power that music has on the human psyche. More specifically, **_Vibez_** is based around sharing music playlists and the conversations that can spring up from the free exchange of information and art. In our application, people can sign up, create playlists, listen to those playlists, listen to the playlists of other people, make posts on playlists, comment on the posts, and like posts. We chose to use the Spotify API because so many people already have an account with it, despite having heard tell of its notoriety for being difficult to inteact with.

### summary of user research  
    The preferences for the colour scheme was for darker colours, blue in particular, with clear contrasts.  Fonts that are easily legible, with rounded edges, such as sans serif fonts seemed to be the preference for the main text, and the secondary font might be a serif font.  There were a variety of design suggestions, and there was a plethora of genres suggested. The prospective users’ responses did suggest that they generally expected that they would be able to listen to full songs, so we were led to the decision that in order to fulfil the users’ expectations, we would need to have them log into something such as spotify, and we chose spotify because it has the most existing subscribers, thereby reducing the inconvenience on the users.
  
### unsolved problems  
  We had unresolved problems with heroku and getting the user data, so we were unable to get full CRUD on users.  We were able to successfully deploy our application on Heroku up until recently, and we were working on localhost and did not get to switch the routes back.
  
### future enhancements
  We would want to add a chat room for people to be able to discuss music and even jam together with extemporaneous music.
